# A simple token🪙
This is a simple token written on solidity which mints and burns according to the user. this program is written in solidity and compiled in remix IDE.This is my first project after learning solidity from meta masters.

# Description📝
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two functions **min** and **burn**.The min function will be used to mint the tokens which will be updated in the user's balance after minting.The burn function will be used to burn the tokens in the user's account which will be updated as well.

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

1.create a file with name of your choice in the left hand RYHERIUM IDE.
2.To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 
3.Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.
4.Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 
5.Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

## That's it you have created a simple token with solidity😁
